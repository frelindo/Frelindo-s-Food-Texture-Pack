Removed :

Modified :

	->	textures : gui : title : mojangstudios{.png;.xcf} = first 'O' in 'MOJANG STUDIOS' (M>O<JANG STUDIOS) is replaced by Donut (similar texture to the second 'O', but bigger and smoothed) with frosting. Removed unnecessary colors (colors are been ignored).

	+	all golden armor items (what you see in the inventory and not on the skin) = chocolate armor
	+	entire GUI = chocolaty GUI
	+ 	splash with something related to Taco Bell
(	+	anyone ideas?)
